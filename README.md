# CS441_Drawing
## Objective
My goal is pretty much to create a drawing board. I want the user to be able to draw and erase from a canvas. Maybe eventually the canvas can be a picture from the camera roll?
I want the brush size and color to be selectable. We'll see if this all gets done or if I end up adding more!

## Production Log
**9/9/19:** Began project. Defined buttons and LinearLayouts so that next time I can get right into writing new and meaningful code.
